# zelazny

### Installation Instructions

1. Clone or download zelazny and nwjs (https://nwjs.io/downloads/).  You can skip nwjs if you don't want to use the executable mode or the editor

2. Unzip nwjs into a folder called 'nwjs' in the root of your zelazny folder (obviously only if you included it)

3. 'npm install'

4. 'npm run edit' will bring you into the editor and get you creating as quickly as possible.  'npm run dist' will create a web-client distribution which doesn't need node.  If you don't have node.js installed and don't want it you can run devops/dist.bat to create this distribution and use it as the template for a web project.

### Okay but WTF is this?

In brief it is a narrative game engine written in javascript for text-based games, visual novels and CRPG-type games.  See http://tweng.co for documentation, an online IDE and sandbox to play in.
